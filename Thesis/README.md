# MSc Thesis writing

Possibly a good workflow is preparing the set-up:
1) BIG SCREEN AVAILABLE:
* On the big screen opening and having on the right or left side:
	+ (On the left side) A thesis writing-tips document (e.g. from Jim Tørresen) and your own MSc document
	+ (On the right side) Good MSc theses examples (as many as is needed or useful, in the order 'Nygaard, Samuelsen, Ruud')
* On the smaller laptop-screen:
	+ Notepad++ with the master.tex-document, this README, the various Chapters for the master.tex that you're working on

2) ONLY LAPTOP AVAILABLE:
* Think of something you want to take inspiration from or compare to, w.r.t. something you could write about right now (something that's on your mind)
	+ View the inspiration in a top-left corner of the window
	+ Open Notepad++ and your MSc-document in the middle
	+ View your resulting MSc-PDF in the bottom right corner of the window

## Specific TODOs:
* Get Section-headlines as big and nice-looking as in the 'good-masters-thesis'-examples (get familiar with and use the titlesec-package, and compare it with the Overleaf-IFI-standard-document and the formerly-mentioned MSc-thesises).
* Klargjøre for meg selv og forenkle så mye som mulig fargekodingen innad i MSc-dokumentet (rød vs. blå skrift osv.)
	+ Kanskje lage egendefinerte funksjoner som gjør det klart for meg hva de forskjellige avsnittene og setningene og ordene betyr.
		- Opphøy liten tekst for å ha noe i mente ang. det som nettop sto.
* Fix citation-links (throughout the thesis document when references are cited)
