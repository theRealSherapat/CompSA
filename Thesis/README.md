# MSc Thesis writing

### While having displayable writing-inspirations:
Possibly a good workflow is preparing the set-up:
1) BIG SCREEN AVAILABLE:
* On the big screen opening and having on the right or left side:
	+ (On the left side) A thesis writing-tips document (e.g. from Jim Tørresen) and your own MSc document
	+ (On the right side) Good MSc theses examples (as many as is needed or useful, in the order 'Nygaard, Samuelsen, Ruud')
* On the smaller laptop-screen:
	+ Notepad++ with the master.tex-document, this README, the various Chapters for the master.tex that you're working on
2) ONLY LAPTOP AVAILABLE:
* Think of something you want to take inspiration from or compare to, w.r.t. something you could write about right now (something that's on your mind)
	+ View the inspiration in a top-left corner of the window
	+ Open Notepad++ and your MSc-document in the middle
	+ View your resulting MSc-PDF in the bottom right corner of the window

## Specific TODOs
* Make Section-headlines (and possibly the 2nd thesis-title, like in the Overleaf-IFI-standard-document) bold-face (by still using the package 'sectsty' if possible).
* Create Chapters (like in the 'good-masters-thesis'-examples), looking more or less like these examples.
* Fix citation-links (throughout the thesis document when references are cited).
* 'GJØR: []'-clauses possible to execute now (remember Abe Lincoln).
