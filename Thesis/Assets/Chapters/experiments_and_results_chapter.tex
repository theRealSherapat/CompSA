	\section{Solving the simpler $\phi-$problem}
	This is the section for the experiments attempting to solve the first and simpler problem, namely synchronizing the phases $\phi_i$ of all agents $i$. \nl

We here measure how long it takes 6 agents to synchronize their phases to each other, given the two different phase-adjustment methods. 30 individual runs per phase-adjustment method were performed in Unity for a collective-size of 6 agents, and $\alpha=0.2$ e.g.}

	\section{Solving the harder $\phi\&\omega-$problem}
	
	This is the section for the experiments attempting to solve the second and harder problem of synchronizing both phases $\phi_i$, as well as frequencies $\omega_i$, for all agents $i$.
