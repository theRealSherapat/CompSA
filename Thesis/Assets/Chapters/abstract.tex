\chapter*{Abstract}
	\gjor{Tenk igjennom og besvar så godt som mulig etterhvert:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item What Is \textit{Self-Awareness}, according to some of history's most prominent thinkers, including central philosophers and psychologists? Or first things first, what Is \textit{the self}? And what exactly is \textit{awareness}? What implications does this have as it pertains to the domain and practice of computer science and engineering — especially when designing and describing computing systems? What lessons can designers and researchers of computing systems learn, what can they be inspired by, and which computational benefits/advancements in engineering can be made when exploring the answers to these questions?
		\end{itemize}
	}
	
	\inkl{Despite its elusive, and at times hard-to-tangibly-define, nature; the psychological concept of Self-Awareness have relatively recently served as a rich source of new inspiration, previously unknown or undiscovered for the computer engineer.}
