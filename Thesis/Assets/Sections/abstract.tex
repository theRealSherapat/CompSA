And what exactly is \textit{awareness}? What implications does this have as it pertains to the domain and practice of computer science and engineering â€” especially when designing and describing computing systems? What lessons can designers and researchers of computing systems learn, what can they be inspired by, and which computational benefits/advancements in engineering can be made when exploring the answers to these questions?}
