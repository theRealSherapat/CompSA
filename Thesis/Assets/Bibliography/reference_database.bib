			abstract = {Self-awareness concepts from psychology are inspiring new approaches for engineering computing systems which operate in complex dynamic environments. There has been a broad and long-standing interest in self-awareness for computing, but only recently has a systematic understanding of self-awareness and how it can be used and evaluated been developed. In this chapter, we take inspiration from human self-awareness to develop new notions of computational self-awareness and self-expression. We translate concepts from psychology to the domain of computing, introducing key ideas in self-aware computing. In doing so, this chapter therefore paves the way for subsequent work in this book.},

			abstract = {This chapter covers a reference architecture for describing and engineering computational self-awareness and self-expression in computing systems. The architecture provides a common language with which to engineer the capabilities exercised by a “self” at a fine resolution inspired by concepts from psychology. The “self” demarked by the reference architecture is conceptual in nature, and therefore not limited to describing single agents. Consequently, the architecture allows the engineering exercise to scale freely across systems composed of arbitrary agent collectives. Being a common language, it paves a way for identifying architectural patterns influencing the engineering of computational self-awareness and self-expression capabilities across a range of applications. The psychological basis of the architecture brings clarity to the notion of self-awareness and self-expression in computing. These foundations also serve as a rich source of ideas which can now be channelled into the computing domain and inspire the engineering of computationally self-aware and self-expressive systems of the future.},

When attempting to endow computing systems with a form of self-awareness, it is important to have a clear understanding of what that form looks like. This chapter therefore first introduces the general concept of self-awareness and its various facets. Second, we provide an overview of the range of efforts to interpret the concept of self-awareness in computing. Third, we provide a structured conceptual framework that organizes this variety of different forms of self-awareness. This provides a broad set of concepts and a language that can be used to describe and reason about self-aware computing systems.},

Though psychology itself is a very different discipline in the 21st-century, James’s influence continues to be felt – both within the field and beyond. At base, Principles was designed to be a textbook for what was then an emerging field: a summary and explanation of what was known at that point in time. As its continuing influence shows, though, it became far more – a success due in part to the strength of James’s analytical skills and creative thinking. On the one hand, James was a masterful analyst, able to break down what was known in psychology, to trace how it fitted together, and, crucially, to point out the gaps in psychologists’ knowledge. Beyond that, though, he was a creative thinker, who looked at things from different angles and proposed inventive solutions and hypotheses. Among his best known was an entirely new theory of emotion (the James-Lange theory), and the influential notion of the “stream of consciousness” – the latter of which has influenced generations of psychologists and artists alike.},
