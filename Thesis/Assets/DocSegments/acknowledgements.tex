Thank you to all who have helped me along during this thesis. I hope you know you have been helpful and that I have managed to express it. If not, here it goes.

Thank you to Kyrre H. Glette for always quality supervision and many lessons taught. Also thank you Frank Veenstra for helping me get out of the Unity rabbithole. Thanks to Pierre Potel who let me reuse his work from his \textit{SoloJam-Island} Unity project. Thanks to all that have gone through either code, text in the report, or heard me talk about the thesis—especially Tommy, Kjersti, Sigmund, my dad, Gunnar, and Birk. Thank you to my mom and dad for always being there for me throughout my life. And last but not least, thank you to my dearest fiancée (my Jari) who has always been there for me and cheered me on during the thesis work.

Also thank you to everyone who has prayed for me—you know who you are. \nl
